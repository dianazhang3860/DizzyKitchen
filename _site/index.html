			<p>Banana bread is one of those healthy, unhealthy snacks. Its sweet and full of cinnamon flavor, but you’re also getting a small serving of fruit, which of course, makes everything healthy again. What makes a good banana bread is the texture. It should rise like cake, but still remain moist on the inside. I was suddenly inspired to make this recipe because of my friend Isabella and her mother’s AMAZING banana bread recipe. It was the night before I left for China. My closest Princeton friends threw me a going-away party and Isabella brought banana bread that her mother just mailed over. Let me tell you, midnight snacking amidst happy tears is probably one the best feelings in the world.</p>

			<p>Apple pie, one of classic staples of Thanksgiving dinner. Bringing a feeling of warmth and holiday cheer, it is a must-have at the dinner table. What I made today is a slightly healthy versions of this delectable dish. Let’s start with the crust. we all know that apple pie has this beautiful golden buttery crush. News flash, butter isn’t exactly good for the arteries, so I’ve replaced the butter crust with an olive oil crust. After baking, the crust came out quite nice actually. It wasn’t as flakey as the classic crust, but it wasn’t as crumbly as a graham-cracker crust. All in all, would recommend for you guys to try.</p>

			<p>Sweet potato fries has been the ultimate childhood favorite of mine. There was this shop basically walking distance from my house that sold boba and asian quick eats. I remember every time I went there, I would make a huge deal out of it. My favorite favorite favorite thing to order there was their sweet potato fries and crispy chicken.</p>

			<p>Eating mooncake during the Mid-Autumn Festival has always been a Chinese family tradition. The first mooncake appeared back in 1600 B.C. and regained its popularity in the second century Han Dynasty. Sharing resemblance with the celestial object (the moon), mooncakes nowadays have eight different variations, depending on where their origins are in China. One of the most popular fillings for mooncakes is the salted duck egg yolk. The most luxurious of the pastries will contain four egg yolks, each to represent a phase of the moon.</p>

			<p>Boba milk tea was basically my entire childhood. I vividly remember in high school, we would create these lists that ranked the best boba shop to the worst. Even though it was so delicious, it can get a little expensive. With this recipe,
you can make a ton at a very low price. This treat super fun to make with family or with friends and because you are working with dough, don’t be afraid to play around and make your own shapes! Plus, hand-making the tapioca pearls is a good alternative because then you know exactly what you are putting in your body. There’s nothing processed, nothing faked. This is just about as natural as you can get with a drink like this.</p>
