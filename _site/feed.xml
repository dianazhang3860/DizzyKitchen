With this recipe,
you can make a ton at a very low price. This recipe is super fun to make with family or with friends and because you are working with dough, don’t be afraid to play around and make your own shapes! Plus, hand-making the tapioca pearls is a good alternative because then you know exactly what you are putting in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this recipe, you can really make it your own. You can swap out the matcha powder for strawberry ice cream or mango puree. You can even try green tea instead of black tea. Using almond or cashew milk instead of regular milk is super delicious as well!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve found at parties people prefer bite sized deserts so I’d recommend making 24 mini cupcakes rather than 12 large. That way you won’t find half eaten cupcakes at your party!&lt;/p&gt;
