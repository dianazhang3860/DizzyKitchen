Apple pie, one of classic staples of Thanksgiving dinner. Bringing a feeling of warmth and holiday cheer, it is a must-have at the dinner table. What I made today is a slightly healthy versions of this delectable dish. Let’s start with the crust. we all know that apple pie has this beautiful golden buttery crush. News flash, butter isn’t exactly good for the arteries, so I’ve replaced the butter crust with an olive oil crust. After baking, the crust came out quite nice actually. It wasn’t as flakey as the classic crust, but it wasn’t as crumbly as a graham-cracker crust. All in all, would recommend for you guys to try.

Also instead of sprinkling a ton of sugar on the apples to draw out moisture, I instead opted for some honey. It was a really nice alternative actually. The honey itself is quite sweet and fragrant, so it was a nice pairing with the tart, crisp apples.

So in theory, my pie was supposed to turn out to be super beautiful, but as you can see from the pictures, it was quite the opposite. It was a tragedy, I made my crust a little too thick for this one, so for those of you trying to make this, be careful!

Note: Butter is super expensive here in China, so I adapted my no-butter crust recipe from King Arthur Flour. Check it out here: https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-roll-pie-crust-recipe

P.S. Yes, I know it took me two months to post, but I’m working on it!
