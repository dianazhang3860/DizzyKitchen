Sweet potato fries has been the ultimate childhood favorite of mine. There was this shop basically walking distance from my house that sold boba and asian quick eats. I remember every time I went there, I would make a huge deal out of it. My favorite favorite favorite thing to order there was their sweet potato fries and crispy chicken.

Anyways, I digress. This dish is super easy to make. It took no time at all and plus, it's way healthier than having deep friend potatoes. Not only are sweet potatoes a good source of fiber, but they also very low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Basically they are root vegetable that are filled with nutrients, so you won't feel guilty when consuming it!

For next time, I would probably line my pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper. These will stick. Believe me, I learned that the hard way. I will also play with the flavors a little more by adding some garlic powder or paprika. Recently, my dad gifted me worcestershire pepper. I don't know why, but I'm just not going to ask. Apparently, its some type of seasoning for barbecues, but I'm sure it will taste great with these sweet potatoes. I wanted to keep it simple for this round, but I will definitely spice it up next time. No pun intended!
