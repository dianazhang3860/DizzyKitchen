Banana bread is one of those healthy, unhealthy snacks. Its sweet and full of cinnamon flavor, but you’re also getting a small serving of fruit, which of course, makes everything healthy again. What makes a good banana bread is the texture. It should rise like cake, but still remain moist on the inside. I was suddenly inspired to make this recipe because of my friend Isabella and her mother’s AMAZING banana bread recipe. It was the night before I left for China. My closest Princeton friends threw me a going-away party and Isabella brought banana bread that her mother just mailed over. Let me tell you, midnight snacking amidst happy tears is probably one the best feelings in the world.

This recipe was probably one of the easiest ones to make. You basically just dump everything into a bowl, stir, shove it in an oven and hope everything works out. There are so many variations of banana bread. The world is your oyster; you can put anything you like in the batter. Chocolate chips is good choice (shoutout to Elaine for the idea) and I really like adding in walnuts for texture. Unfortunately, I didn’t have walnuts at home when I tried to make this, so I chose gogi berries instead. The texture of the berries when baked blends in with the bread, but it adds an almost bitter taste that nicely balances with the sweetness of the bananas. Plus, the red adds a nice pop of color doesn’t it?

In all honesty, my final product wasn’t at all perfect, but it tasted marvelous! I just wish the batter could’ve rose a little more, so I adjusted the baking powder/baking soda ratio in the recipe. My oven is pretty atypical, so my baking process was a little complicated than what it should look like. Please try out this recipe when you get the chance. It's perfect to bring to potlucks, share with friends, or just to snack by yourself.

P.S. Don’t forget to test if your bread is ready by using a toothpick to poke it. If it comes out clean, then its done!
